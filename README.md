<h1>Static Composition Challenge 2</h1>

<p>This project was made for a class assignment. It is meant to copy a certain layout exactly. However the contents within the layout were open to artistic license. As such it represents a voting list for various songs. The photo for every selection is identical as this part was not the focus of the project. The color combination was copied exactly from the project description.</p>
